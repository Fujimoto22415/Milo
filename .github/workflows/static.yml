                The Cold War was an unforgiving global incident, which was more than just a battle of ideologies; it was a silent war that lasted for a long time, fought through spying, using economic advantage, and strange countermeasures. The whole planet was under the influence of the tension between the United States and the Soviet Union for several decades, a rivalry that not only risked mutual annihilation but also the terrible use of science for making weapons.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the same time, the Foundation and various national anomalous organizations (like the Global Occult Coalition, and pre-cursor agencies) were in a race of their own, competing to secure or weaponize each of the nuclear by-products that came out of the shadows. Even though the world was focused on the tanks and missiles, the real war was about to be fought in terms of information, cognition, and manipulation of the collective unconsciousness.
            </p>
            <p>
                By the end of the 1980s, contrary to what was believed, the Soviet Union had not only invented but also deployed a wide array of extremely volatile conceptual and psychological weapons aimed at saving its destabilized political structure. The fall of the Soviet Union was not a matter of inevitability, rather it was an ongoing, dangerous scenario. The French Forces, recognizing the threat to existence that the unpredictable and unstable disintegration of the USSR could lead to conceptual SCPs being released all over the world, therefore initiated a secret, daring plan.

                <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 0.95rem;">
                    Thus, the French planned an operation...
                    Its primary goal was to ensure the stable, non-violent political and infrastructural collapse necessary to prevent Soviet anomalies from becoming global kinetic threats.

            <p>
                The French Government, during the late 1980s, amidst the geopolitical tension that was swirling around, decided to employ a man named <span class="highlight-text">Milo Vicquemare</span>. A man, who was of tall stature and rather skinny, seemed like a perfect candidate for the job of a spy. He was initially tasked with spying on the Soviets however, during the Cold War, he was only collaborating with the French. Almost without anyone noticing, on the basis of his documents, he managed to set up a whole recruiting system very quickly by going from one place to the other, therefore, he created an extensive network of quite competent agents who had military and intelligence experience in the regions of Central and Eastern Europe.
            </p>
            <p>
                During this time, the Foundation and several national anomalous organizations (such as the Global Occult Coalition and pre-cursor agencies) were fiercely competing with each other to grab control over every hidden thing that came out of the nuclear shadows. While the world was focused on the tanks and missiles, the real war was about information, cognition, and the manipulation of the collective unconsciousness.
            </p>
            <p>
                By the late 1980s the Soviet Union was a very different place from what it looked like. It had developed and deployed many highly volatile conceptual and psychological weapons of a very advanced nature in order to stabilize its political structure which was in a very bad state. The collapse was not a matter of inevitability; it was an active and dangerous scenario. The French Forces decided to intervene in a very secretive and very dangerous way when they realized that the disintegration of the USSR was going to be the most dangerous threat to the existence of the world, that it would be very unstable and that it would very probably result in the release of many conceptual SCPs previously contained in different places in the world. So, the French created an operation.
